              Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different purposes, 
              like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, 
              remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience.

            <v-row no-gutter class="Body1 tw-break-words pt-6">
              Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies 
              (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them).

            <v-row no-gutter class="Body1 tw-break-words pt-6">
              We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; 
              and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by these parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. Third party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising and social media features.

              In addition to cookies, our Sites and emails may use other technologies to collect information. For example, 
              we may use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and whether recipients of our marketing emails open or click links within them. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. 
              Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails (e.g., they may tell us whether you have opened an email, and/or forwarded it on to someone else) and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.‍

              We may use third-party software development kits (“SDKs”) in our mobile applications. A SDK is third-party computer code that may be used for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our mobile applications, to integrate with social media, add features or functionality to our app, 
              or to facilitate online advertising. SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly from our mobile app.
